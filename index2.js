/* M02 W05 CHALLENGE: ISS SPOTTER (INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION)
 *
 * Note: This challenge is implemented first WITHOUT promises and then WITH
 * promises. For this reason, it has been implemented twice in two sets of
 * files: The version WITHOUT promises is implemented in `index.js` and
 * `iss.js`. The version WITH promises is implemented in `index2.js` and
 * `iss_promised.js`.
 *
 * THE CHALLENGE: ISS SPOTTER WITH PROMISES
 *
 * In order to use promises, our HTTP request library needs to support them.
 * `request`, which we've used thus far, does not use promises. We need an
 * alternative.
 *
 * Note: There are various node libraries for making HTTP requests using
 * promises.
 *
 * For now, we will use `request-promise-native` even though it is not the most
 * popular. We pick it because it is related to the `request` library, which
 * we've already used and are somewhat comfortable with.
